### Hi there! I'm [Aayush](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayushah19/)!

Hi there, I'm [Aayush](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayushah19/) - a recent (2021) graduate from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I'm a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist with over two years of experience working in fast-scaling & high-performance teams.

Currently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Stats Perform aiming to build a platform to help Data Scientists and AI Scientists in productionizing their models. I have also recently worked as a Student Researcher at Microsoft and at [TerraClear Inc.](https://www.terraclear.com/) as a Software Engineer. I have a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai - [K.J Somaiya College of Engineering](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/en).

I'm super enthusiastic about learning new technologies and how these can be best used in my job! I often gravitate towards project making me think out of the box and am always up for any new and exciting opportunities coming my way.

Oh, and also, I'm a sports buff and a HUGE Formula 1 fan. Hit me up if you want to talk sports, machine learning, data science, or anything fun in life! :)
